title: Multiline Parser
---

A detailed look at how to setup Promtail to process multiline log lines.

A complete config file sample:

```yaml
   multiline_parser:
      mode: "newline"
      expression: '^time:'
      first: '^(.*)$'
      next: '^\s+(.*)$' 
      delimiter: ' '
      max_wait: '5s'
```

The [`mode`](#Multiline modes) defines the global behaviour of the parser. With `expression` you 
 can define the regular expression that extracts (capturing groups) the text to append to the multiline log.
 [`first`](#First and Next Expressions)  and 
 [`next`](#First and Next Expressions) 
 allows to refine the text extracted from the first and next log lines.
  [`delimiter`](#Delimiter) allows you to specify the
 text used to join the log lines. [`max_wait`](#Max Wait) limit the time a multilog line cab be hold by the parser.
  Only `mode`and `expression` are required. 
  
  You can view some typical examples [here](#Common Examples).

## Max Wait

A `max_wait` config is provided in order to not hold the grouping lines too much: 
- The parser cannot determine when the next line is part of the current line group or not until the next line is parsed.
- For the "Continue Mode" there is not guarantee that the continued log line will appear soon, if ever. 

The `max_wait` must not be greater than the position sync period (`positions.sync-period`). *The lines in the grouping 
phase could be lost if some crash occurs when the position of the first line of the multiline log is sync to disk*.

The default value for `max_wait` is "5s".

## First and Next Expressions

Sometimes you need to filter the log lines. You can use `first` regular expresion to select the text to be added as the
first line of the multiline log. You can use `next` regular expression to select the text to be added to the multiline
log. 

## Delimiter 

The `delimiter` text is added between lines. So, for example you can use `delimiter: '\n'` to preserve line breaks. The
default delimiter is empty.


## Multiline modes

The parses has defined some modes of operation to ease the use of distinct use cases in which a multiline parser
 is required. This modes are:
 
- New Line Mode: A new multine starts when a "newline" regular expression match.
- Continue Mode: A line that match a "continue" regular expresion are joined with the next one.
- Group Mode: A "group" regular expression is used to determine the group a line belongs to.
- Unordered Group Mode: This is a "Group Mode" but tracking multiple group keys simultaneously. So the lines can be
 parsed unordered.

### New Line Mode

In the multiline mode the lines are joined until a new line mark is found. Then the previous collected lines are 
processed as a single one.

#### Example:

Given the following log lines:

```
log line 1
    sub log line 1.1
log line 2
    sub log line 2.1
```

We can define the multiline parser:

```yaml
   multiline_parser:
      mode: "newline"
      expression: '^[^ ]'
```

The following multilog lines are generated:

```
log line 1    sub log line 1.1
log line 2    sub log line 2.1
```

We can use `next` regular expression to remove the prefix spaces and `delimiter` to separate joined lines with a space:

```yaml
   multiline_parser:
      mode: "newline"
      expression: '^[^ ]",'
      next: '^\s*(.*)$'
      delimmiter: ' '
```
Parsing the previous log now gives:
```
log line 1 sub log line 1.1
log line 2 sub log line 2.1
```

## Continue Mode

A line that match a "continue" regular expresion are joined with the next one.


#### Example 1:

Given the following log lines:

```
log event #
one
log event #
two
```

We can define the multiline parser as:

```yaml
   multiline_parser:
      mode: "continue"
      expression: '^(.*)#$'
```

The following multilog lines are parsed:

```
log event one
log event two
```

#### Example 2:

Given the following log lines:

```
t1: log event \
t1: one
t2: log event \
t2: two
```

We can define the multiline parser as:

```yaml
   multiline_parser:
      mode: "continue"
      expression: '^(.*)\\$'
      next: '^t.: :(.*)$' 
```

The following multilog lines are parsed:

```
t1: log event one
t2: log event two
```

NOTE:
We can use `next` and `prev` regular expressions but remmber the regular expression is applied to the line with the
 selected text and not the full log line.
 
 
## Group Mode

 A "group" regular expression is used to determine the group key for a log line. All the lines with same group key are
 joined.


#### Example 1:

Given the following log lines:

```
request_id:1 log event
request_id:1 one
request_id:2 log event
request_id:2 two
```

We can define the multiline parser as:

```yaml
   multiline_parser:
      mode: "group"
      expression: 'request_id:(\S+)'
```

We are selecting the lines key as the value of the request_id

The following multilog lines are parsed:

```
request_id:1 log event one
request_id:2 log event two
```

NOTE: The group key is keep at the first line but removed for the next lines. You can override this behaviour using 
`next`and `first` regular expressions. 


# Unordered Group Mode
 
Sometimes the log lines are not perfectly ordered. In these cases you can use unordererd group mode to track multiple
log lines and group them together. The parses tries to preserve the order of the log lines as much as possible.


#### Example:

Given the following log lines:

```
request_id:1 log event
request_id:2 two
request_id:2 log event
request_id:1 one
```

We can define the multiline parser as:

```yaml
   multiline_parser:
      mode: "unordered_group"
      expression: 'request_id:(\S+)'
```

We are selecting the lines key as the value of the request_id

The following multilog lines are parsed:

```
request_id:1 log event one
request_id:2 log event two
```
